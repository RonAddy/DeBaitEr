**An app for the 21st century millennial. The one who wants to get things of their chest about society.**

## Description
>I wanted to create this app to centralize the 'ever-so friendly' comment sections of the numerous applications out there, but giving users an incentive to generate and contribute to meaningful debates.

>The app will allow usrs to login, create username, and explore the different articles of the day. Each article will be displayed for a certain time limit. Any logged in user can enter the debate section to add their opinions and read other users opinions. Users can like other users statements and the user with the most likes by the end of the debate will be crowned the King deBAITer. Users won debates will be logged in database.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on app structure

>Working with the sockets.io package will probably be the biggest challenge for me. I want to delve into the documentation and see the possibilities. I also need to figure out a working 'like' system as this is one of the main parts of the app. 

## Phases of Completion

Pre-Work
PHASE 1: Wireframes
PHASE 2: Figure out database structure, needed tables.

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
